      "PASSAGES: no drive applied to the wheels with the engine running\n",
      "D = Drive - forward motion with full automatic operation in all gears.\n",
      "All automatics use some sort of manual override of the transmission, with numbered positions in descending order marked below (or to the right) of \"Drive\", which will prevent the transmission shifting to a gear higher than the selected, but maintaining automatic operation between all lesser numbered gears.  Such gates will appear as \"P-R-N-D-3-2-1\" for example. On some vehicles (mainly Japanese makes such as Honda, Toyota and Lexus being good examples) these numbered positions are replaced by a single the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.\n",
      "Manual transmissions are characterized by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) gearing controlled by brake bands and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no distinction between the two terms need be made.\n",
      "Contemporary automobile manual transmissions typically use four to selection of gear ratios. Many vehicles offer a 5-speed or 6-speed manual, whereas the automatic option would typically be a 4-speed. This is generally due to the increased space available inside a manual transmission compared with an automatic, since the latter requires extra components for self-shifting, such as torque converters and pumps. However, automatic transmissions are now adding more speeds as the technology matures. ZF currently manufactures 7- and 8-speed automatic transmissions. ZF is also planning a 9-speed automatic for use in front-wheel drive vehicles. The increased number of gears allows for better use of the engine's power band, resulting for vehicles equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) 2.7L HDi Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17 which is used in a number of Ford, Peugeot, Citroen, Jaguar and Land Rover models.\n",
      "From model years 1999 to 2002, the rear-wheel-drive S-Type was equipped with either a five-speed manual (Getrag 221) or a five-speed J-Gate Ford 5R55N transmission . From 2003, the S-Type was produced with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a six-speed J-Gate transmission that allows automatic gear selection or clutchless manual gear selection. The 2004 diesel saw the introduction of a 6-speed manual transmission; it was also available with the six-speed J-Gate automatic transmission. Reception The car was praised on its or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission.  Various gear sets and final drives were used between trims and model years, resulting here are 4 different manual transmission combinations:\n",
      "CX/DX hatchback, HX Coupe: Tall gearing with a 3.722 final drive\n",
      "DX/LX coupe/sedan: Same transmission gearing as CX/DX hatchback and HX coupe but with a 4.058 final drive\n",
      "EX hatchback/coupe/sedan: Shorter gearing than all the variants save for the Si with a 4.25 final drive\n",
      "Si Coupe: Shortest gearing of all the 6th generation Honda Civics, 4.266 final drive, available in manual transmission only.\n",
      "The HX trim was offered with the 5-speed manual or a CVT Continuously should occur.\n",
      "In many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, a driving licence issued for only vehicles with an automatic transmission is not valid for driving vehicles with a manual transmission, but a licence for manual transmissions covers both. This is also the case for P1 (provisional-1) car licence holders in New South Wales, Australia, but P2 (provisional-2) licence holders are allowed to drive vehicles with either transmission. Shifting speed Automatic transmissions can typically shift ratios faster than a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to push the clutch pedal to the for an automatic gearbox compared to the United States. In some Asian markets and in Australia, automatic transmissions have become very popular since the 1980s.\n",
      "Vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions are not as complex to drive. Consequently, in some jurisdictions, drivers who have passed their driving test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission will not be licensed to drive a manual transmission vehicle. Conversely, a manual license will allow the driver to drive vehicles with either an automatic or manual transmission. Countries in which such driving license restrictions are applied include some states in Australia, Austria, Botswana, Belgium, Belize, China, figures are also up as compared to previous variants 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m) for manual transmission cars and 332 lb⋅ft (450 N⋅m) for cars with automatic transmission due to launch control and fast gear change ratios. This version is also the lightest and tips the scale at 1,258 kg (2,773 lb) for manual transmission cars and 1,310 kg (2,888 lb) for automatic transmission cars. The cars with automatic transmission weigh more due to the added weight of the gear box and its cooling system. Top speed also varies for manual and automatic cars due to added weight and gearbox differences and are rated at 174 mph (280 km/h) for automatic integrated control system handles manipulation of the clutch automatically, but the driver can still—and may be required to—take manual control of gear selection. This is sometimes called a \"clutchless manual\", or \"automated manual\" transmission. Many of these transmissions allow the driver to fully delegate gear shifting choice to the control system, which then effectively acts as if it was a regular automatic transmission. They are generally designed using manual transmission \"internals\", and when used in passenger cars, have synchromesh operated helical constant mesh gear sets.\n",
      "Early semi-automatic systems used a variety of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical \n",
      "GENERATED ANSWER: The good side of manual transmission is better fuel economy, more control over gear selection, and better responsiveness for high performance driving. The bad side is that it can be more complex to drive and requires more skill. The good side of automatic transmission is easier to drive, faster shifting, and less shock to the chassis. The bad side is lower fuel economy and less control over gear selection.\n",
      "REFERENCE: Automatics weigh more, so that alone makes gas mileage worse.  They are also more complicated, so that means reliability is going to be lower.  It is easier to operate, which may free up your attention for focus on what is *outside* the car.\n",
